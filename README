Northstar is a metrics gathering and reporting framework.  
It is devided into two componants:

1) The 'northstar' application which pulls data from 
   ZFS, Solaris kstats, Solaris rcapd, ipmitool and other 
   system utilities to create static HTML to STDOUT.

2) A series of scripts which create, update, and generate
   RRD graphs which are referenced by northstar's HTML
   for trending analysis of its point-in-time data.
